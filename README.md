## C++ Lua Testcase

Study project for understanding, how to implement other language into C++.
Lua by many reasons is a best choice for me

- Program can load and execute Lua scripts
- Program provides API for Lua for interaction with C++ code
- Program call functions with predefined signature, like `log`

This is not a real app for any production in any case, just study how to use it
